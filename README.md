# getglebbs2
GetgleBBS Sucessor with a cleaner codebase and MySQL instead of flatfiles.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code is self documenting :^) i dont have to write any documentation.

Pros:
Runs much better than the original GetgleBBS,
Cleaner codebase than GetgleBBS,
Very modular and easy to work with object-oriented code.
It's objected oriented

Cons:
It's object oriented.
I didn't implement bumping yet, GetgleBBS has it but not GetgleBBS2
