# getglebbs2
GetgleBBS Sucessor with a cleaner codebase and MySQL instead of flatfiles.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code is self documenting :^) i dont have to write any documentation.

Pros:
Runs much better than the original GetgleBBS,
Cleaner codebase than GetgleBBS,
Very modular and easy to work with object-oriented code.
It's objected oriented

Cons:
It's object oriented.
I didn't implement bumping yet, GetgleBBS has it but not GetgleBBS2
It's a clusterfuck in some places because I had to port the flatfile database to mysql sloppily and include some legacy cruft from the old codebase in the new codebase
